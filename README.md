# Etch-a-Sketch
Browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.  
-Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.  Create the divs using JS.  Put the grid squares into a container div (made with html).
-I will use CSS Grid to make the divs appear as a grid.  Be careful with borders/margins as they can adjust the size of the squares.
-Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through your grid  like a pen would.  You can use event listeners for this.
Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.  Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before so that you've got a new sketch pad (set the limit for user input to a max of 100). Research button tags (specifically to make a reset button), prompts.

default is 16x16 generated grid, reset button will clear the divs and also prompt the user for a new grid number that is assigned to both columns and rows.
